## Overview
Everyday we come across various products in our lives, on the digital medium we swipe across hundreds of product choices under one category. It will be tedious for the customer to make selection. Here comes 'reviews' where customers who have already got that product leave a rating after using them and brief their experience by giving reviews. As we know ratings can be easily sorted and judged whether a product is good or bad. But when it comes to sentence reviews we need to read through every line to make sure the review conveys a positive or negative sense. In the era of artificial intelligence, things like that have got easy with the Natural Langauge Processing(NLP) technology

## Motivation
As a beginner in the field of Machine Learning, I wanted to start with NLP. Sentiment analysis is perhaps one of the most popular applications of NLP. My primary reason to learn Machine learning is its application to improve businesses. In today's world opinion information is very important for businesses.They often want to know in time what consumers and the public think of their products and services. However, it is not realistic to manually read every post on the website and extract useful viewpoint information from it. If you do it manually, there is too much data. Sentiment analysis allows large-scale processing of data in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

## Technical Aspects

**SMOTE** - It synthesises new minority instances between existing minority instances. It generates the virtual training records by linear interpolation for the minority class. These synthetic training records are generated by randomly selecting one or more of the k-nearest neighbors for each example in the minority class. After the oversampling process, the data is reconstructed and several classification models can be applied for the processed data.

**TfIdf Vectorizer**-TF-IDF stands for “Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency”. This is a technique to quantify a word in documents, we generally compute a weight to each word which signifies the importance of the word in the document and corpus. This method is a widely used technique in Information Retrieval and Text Mining.

**Stemming**- Itis a method of deriving root word from the inflected word. Here we extract the reviews and convert the words in reviews to its root word. for example,
* Going->go
* Finally->fina
*If you notice, the root words doesn't need to carry a semantic meaning. There is another technique knows as Lemmatization where it converts the words into root words which has a semantic meaning. Simce it takes time. I'm using stemming**

**N-gram analysis**-N-grams of texts are extensively used in text mining and natural language processing tasks. They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given window and when computing the n-grams you typically move one word forward.

**Polarity**-TextBlob returns polarity and subjectivity of a sentence. Polarity lies between [-1,1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment. Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis. For example — emoticons, exclamation mark, emojis, etc.
